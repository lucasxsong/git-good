# git-good

as i recently got into powerlifting and climbing, i realized that the more daily habits i associate with a particular habit, the more i start to like and grow fond of that particular activity. (i have a theory that the brain is happy to have that kind of concrete structure so that it can relax and let memory take over)

i've also had a pretty bad history of being unfocused during work. i can work, but only in short bursts that are interrupted by way too much reddit. lately, i've found that i don't really mind doing computer science work since i do love computers, so i'm trying to learn how best to go about doing my work.

in addition, i have been trying to write more stuff down, and just recently have realized that the system that i have of scribbling down 1-2 line phrases in my phone is not very effective for things that require more explanation.

in addition, i've realized that to get comfortable with git/vim, and find my workflow, i need to spend a little more time on em.

this is an attempt to see if i can program myself to git gooder at work. :3
