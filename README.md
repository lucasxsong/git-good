# git-good

i've recently started powerlifting and rock climbing. with a good chunk of my day going into preparing and doing these activities, realized that the more daily nuances i associate with a particular habit, the more i start to grow fond of it. (maybe my brain is happy to have that kind of structure so that it can let autopilot take over)

i've also had a pretty bad history of being unfocused in my work. often times, i work in short bursts that are interrupted by way too much reddit and random youtube videos. lately, i've found that i really enjoy the work in my computer science classes, so i'm trying to learn how to best go about such work.

in addition, i have been trying to write more stuff down, and recently have realized that the system that i have of scribbling down 1-2 line phrases in my phone is not very effective for things that require more explanation.

finally, i am hoping to get more comfortable with git/vim and other tools, so i am trying to spend a little more time with them outside of class.

this is a project to document my journey in getting better at doing work
